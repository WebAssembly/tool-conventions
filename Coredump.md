This document describes the usage of coredump for post-mortem debugging with
WebAssembly.

# Idea

When WebAssembly enters a trap, it starts unwinding and collects debugging
information. For each stack frame, collect the values in locals (includes
function parameters) and on the stack. Along with binary offsets to resolve to
source file locations. Finally, make a snapshot of the linear memory (or
multiple linear memories when the [multi-memory] feature is used), tables and
globals.

All this information is saved to the file, called the coredump file.

The post mortem analysis is done using the coredump and [DWARF] information.
Similar to the debugging flow with [gdb].

# Implementation status

Stability of this specification is **experimental**.

Tools that support the generation of Wasm coredumps:
- [wasm-edit]
- [Wasmtime]

Debugger that supports post-mortem debugging with Wasm coredumps:
- [wasmgdb]

## Runtime support

Most of the WebAssembly runtimes are already able to present a useful stacktrace
on crash to the user. When they are configured to emit a coredump, they collect
the debugging information and write a coredump file.

An example output:

```
$ my-wasm-runtime module.wasm

Exit 1: Uncaught RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds (core dumped).
```

A coredump file has been generated.

For experimenting, runtime support is not strictly necessary. A tool can
transform the Wasm binary to inject code that will manually unwind the stack and
collect debugging information, for instance [wasm-edit coredump]. Such a
transformation has important limitations; a trap caused by an invalid memory
operation or exception in a host function might not be caught.

## Security and privacy considerations

Using the WebAssembly linear memory for debugging exposes the risk of seeing,
manipulating and/or collecting sensitive informations.

For the user of Wasm coredumps, there's no particular security or privacy
considerations.

## Debugger support

[gdb] doesn't support Wasm coredump and it's unclear if it can. Wasm coredump
differ from ELF coredump in a few significant ways:
- Wasm semantics; usage of locals, globals and the stack.
- The process image is only the Wasm linear memory.
- etc.

For experimenting, a custom tool has been built and mimics [gdb]: [wasmgdb].

It seems possible for Chrome's Wasm debugger extension to support Wasm
coredumps.  Challenges for coredumps in the web context would be to collect the
instance's state as tools like emscripten (and of course most of a larger web
app's state) are in JS rather than Wasm.

# Coredump file format

The coredump file is encoded using the [Wasm binary format], containing:
- general information about the process.
- the threads and stack frames.
- a snapshot of the WebAssembly linear memory or relevant regions.

The order in which they appear in the file is not important.

As opposed to regular Wasm files, Wasm Coredumps are not [instantiated].

`u32` are encoded using [Wasm u32].

## Process information

General information about the process is stored in a [Custom section], called
`core`.

This custom section must only appear once in the coredump file.

```
core         ::= customsec(process-info)
process-info ::= 0x0 executable-name:name
```

## Module information

Information about the modules present in the coredump are stored in a [Custom
section] called `coremodules`.

This custom section must only appear once in the coredump file.

This custom section establishes an index space of modules that can be referenced
in the `coreinstances` custom section (see below).

```
coremodules ::= customsec(vec(coremodule))
coremodule ::= 0x0 module-name:name
```

The `module-name` may be a URL, file path, or other identifier for the module.

## Instance information

Information about the instances present in the coredump are stored in a [Custom
section] called `coreinstances`.

This custom section must only appear once in the coredump file.

This custom section establishes an index space of instances that can be
referenced in `frame` productions within the `corestack` custom section (see
below).

```
coreinstances ::= customsec(vec(coreinstance))
coreinstance ::= 0x0 moduleidx:u32 memories:vec(u32) globals:vec(u32)
```

Each `coreinstance` specifies:

* Which module this is an instance of, via indexing into the `coremodules` index
  space.

* Which of the coredump's memories are this instance's memories, via indexing
  into the memory index space. Memories are listed in instance order: the `i`th
  entry in `coreinstance::memories` is the coredump memory index of this
  instance's `i`th memory.

* Which of the coredump's globals are this instance's globals, via indexing into
  the global index space. Globals are listed in instance order: the `i`th entry
  in `coreinstance::globals` is the coredump global index of this instance's
  `i`th global.

## Thread(s) and stack frames

For each thread a [Custom section], called `corestack`, is used to store the
debugging information.

```
corestack   ::= customsec(thread-info vec(frame))
thread-info ::= 0x0 thread-name:name
frame       ::= 0x0 instanceidx:u32 funcidx:u32 codeoffset:u32 locals:vec(value)
                stack:vec(value)
```

The frames in a `corestack` production are listed from youngest to oldest.

> Example: If `f` calls `g` calls `h`, and `h` traps and the runtime creates a
> coredump, then the coredump's `corestack` will list the frames in this order:
> `h`, `g`, `f`.

The `instanceidx` is an index into the `coreinstances` index space, describing
which instance is associated with this stack frame.

`funcidx` is the WebAssembly function index in the instance's module and
`codeoffset` is the instruction's offset relative to the function's start.

> Note: implementations may leave `codeoffset` offset empty if unknown. Setting
> 0 will point to the function's start.

Local and stack values are encoded using one byte for the type (similar to
Wasm's [Number Types]) followed by bytes representing the actual value:
```
value ::= 0x01       => âˆ…
        | 0x7F n:i32 => n
        | 0x7E n:i64 => n
        | 0x7D n:f32 => n
        | 0x7C n:f64 => n
```

The special byte `0x01` is used to represent a missing value, usually because it
was optimized out by the WebAssembly engine.

## Memory

Each instance's memory is captured in the [Memory Section] and [Data Section].

To determine which memory is associated with which instance(s), you can use the
mapping defined in `coreinstances`.

> Note: A single memory may be associated with multiple instances if it is, for
> example, defined and exported by one instance and imported by another.

> Note: A memory's data may be captured either entirely as one active data
> segment, or as multiple data segments. The latter can be used as a space
> saving mechanism to avoid long runs of zeroes or it can be used to represent
> partial coredumps.

## Globals

Globals are captured in the [Global Section] as constant, non-mutable globals.

To determine which global is associated with which instance(s), you can use the
mapping defined in `coreinstances`.

> Note: A single global may be associated with multiple instances if it is, for
> example, defined and exported by one instance and imported by another.
