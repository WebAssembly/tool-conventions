WebAssembly Tool Conventions
============================

This repository holds documents describing *conventions* useful for coordinating
interoperability between wasm-related tools. This includes descriptions of
intermediate file formats, conventions for mapping high-level language types,
names, and abstraction features to WebAssembly types, identifiers, and
implementations, and schemes for supporting debuggers or other tools.

These conventions are not part of the WebAssembly standard, and are not required
of WebAssembly-consuming implementations to execute WebAssembly code. Tools
producing and working with WebAssembly in other ways also need not follow any of
these conventions. They exist only to support tools that wish to interoperate
with other tools at a higher abstraction level than just WebAssembly itself.

These conventions are also not exclusive. There could be multiple conventions
for a given language for a given purpose. There are natural benefits to
interoperability, but there are many reasons where having more than one way to
do things can also make sense in many circumstances.
