This document describes the "Basic" C ABI for WebAssembly. As mentioned in
[README](README.md), it's not the only possible C ABI. It is the ABI that the
clang/LLVM WebAssembly backend is currently using, and any other C or C++
compiler wishing to be ABI-compatible with it.

wasm32 is ILP32 and wasm64 is LP64. `float` and `double` map to wasmâ€™s `f32` and
`f64` respectively.  Varargs is lowered to passing a pointer to an
explicitly-allocated buffer.  Single-element struct return values are returned
by a normal wasm return value. TODO: Spell this all out in much more detail.

This is just an initial sketch of some content. Obviously, it would be desirable
to go into a lot more detail.

Eventually, some content from the design repo's
[CAndC++](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/CAndC++) should also
be moved here.
