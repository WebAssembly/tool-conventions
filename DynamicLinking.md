WebAssembly Dynamic Linking
===========================

This document describes the early plans for how dynamic linking of WebAssembly modules might work.

Note: there is no stable ABI here yet.

# Dynamic Libraries

A WebAssembly dynamic library is a WebAssembly binary with a special custom section that indicates this is a dynamic library and contains additional information needed by the loader.

## The "dylink" Section

The "dylink" section is defined as:

| Field      | Type        | Description                    |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| memorysize | `varuint32` | Size of the memory area the loader should reserve for the module, which will begin at `env.memoryBase` |
| tablesize  | `varuint32` | Size of the table area the loader should reserve for the module, which will begin at `env.tableBase` |

`env.memoryBase` and `env.tableBase` are `i32` imports that contain offsets into the linked memory and table, respectively. If the dynamic library has `memorysize > 0` then the loader will reserve room in memory of that size and initialize it to zero (note: can be larger than the memory segments in the module, if the dynamic library wants additional space) at offset `env.memoryBase`, and similarly for the table (where initialization is to `null`, i.e., a trap will occur if it is called). The library can then place memory and table segments at the proper locations using those imports.

The "dylink" section should be the very first section in the module; this allows detection of whether a binary is a dynamic library without having to scan the entire contents.

## Interface and usage

A WebAssembly dynamic library has some conventions for how it should be loaded and used:

 * The module can import `env.memory` for memory that is shared with the outside. If it does so, it should import `env.memoryBase`, an `i32`, in which the loader will provide the start of the region in memory which has been reserved and zero-initialized for this module, as described earlier.
 * The module can import `env.table` for a table that is shared with the outside. If it does so, it should import `env.tableBase`, an `i32`, in which the loader will provide the start of the region in the table which has been reserved for this module, as described earlier.
 * The module can export a function called `__post_instantiate`. If it is so exported, the loader will call it after the module is instantiated, at a time when it is ready to be used. (Note: the WebAssembly `start` function is not sufficient in all cases due to reentrancy issues, i.e., the `start` function is called as the module is being instantiated, before it returns its exports, so the outside cannot yet call into the module.)
 * While exported functions are straightforward, exported addresses (i.e., exported indexes of locations in memory or in the table) are exported *before* the loaded module can apply any relocation, since the module cannot add `memoryBase` before it exports them. Thus, the exported address is before relocation; the loader, which knows `memoryBase`, can then calculate the proper relocated and final address of those addresses.

## Implementation Status

Emscripten can load WebAssembly dynamic libraries using `dlopen` and access them using `dlsym`, etc. (See `test_dlfcn_*` in the test suite for examples; `test_dylink_*` are relevant as well.)

Emscripten can create WebAssembly dynamic libraries with its `SIDE_MODULE` option, see [the wiki](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/WebAssembly-Standalone).
