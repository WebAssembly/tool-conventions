WebAssembly Object File Linking
===============================

This document describes the early plans for how static linking of WebAssembly
might work in the clang/LLVM WebAssembly backend and other tools.  As mentioned
in [README](README.md), it is not the only possible way to link WebAssembly
modules.  Note: the ABI described in the document is a work in progress and
**should not be considered stable**.

Each compilation unit is compiled as a "relocatable" WebAssembly module.  These
modules are not expected to be directly executable and have have certain
constraints on them, but are otherwise well-formed WebAssembly modules.  In
order to distinguish relocatable modules the linker can check for the presence
of the ["linking"](#linking-metadata-section) custom section which must exist in
all relocatable modules.

The goal of the linker is to take one or more modules and merge them into
single executable module.  In order to achieve this the following tasks need to
be performed:

- Merging of function sections (re-numbering functions)
- Merging of globals sections (re-numbering globals)
- Merging of data segments (re-positioning data)
- Resolving undefined external references

The linking technique described here is designed to be fast, and avoids having
to disassemble the the code section.  The extra metadata required my the linker
is stored in a custom ["linking"](#linking-metadata-section) section and zero or
more relocation sections whose names begin with "reloc.".  For each section that
requires relocation a "reloc" section will be present in the wasm file.  By
convention the reloc section names end with name of the section that they refer
to: e.g. "reloc.CODE" for code section relocations.  However everything after
the period is ignored and the specific target section is encoded in the reloc
section itself.

Relocation Sections
-------------------

A relocation section is a user-defined section with a name starting with
"reloc." Relocation sections start with an identifier specifying which
section they apply to, and must be sequenced in the module after that
section.

Relocation contain the following fields:

| Field      | Type                | Description                    |
| -----------| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| section_id | `varuint32`         | the section to which the relocations refer. |
| name_len   | `varuint32` ?       | the length of name in bytes, present if `section_id == 0` |
| name       | `bytes` ?           | the name of custom section, present if `section_id == 0` |
| count      | `varuint32`         | count of entries to follow     |
| entries    | `relocation_entry*` | sequence of relocation entries |

A `relocation_entry` is:

| Field    | Type                | Description                    |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| type     | `varuint32`         | the relocation type            |

A relocation type can be one of the following:

- `0 / R_WEBASSEMBLY_FUNCTION_INDEX_LEB` - a function index encoded as a 5-byte
  [varuint32]. Used for the immediate argument of a `call` instruction.
- `1 / R_WEBASSEMBLY_TABLE_INDEX_SLEB` - a function table index encoded as a
  5-byte [varint32]. Used to refer to the immediate argument of a `i32.const`
  instruction, e.g. taking the address of a function.
- `2 / R_WEBASSEMBLY_TABLE_INDEX_I32` - a function table index encoded as a
  [uint32], e.g. taking the address of a function in a static data initializer.
- `3 / R_WEBASSEMBLY_MEMORY_ADDR_LEB` - a linear memory index encoded as a 5-byte
  [varuint32]. Used for the immediate argument of a `load` or `store`
  instruction, e.g. directly loading from or storing to a C++ global.
- `4 / R_WEBASSEMBLY_MEMORY_ADDR_SLEB` - a linear memory index encoded as a 5-byte
  [varint32]. Used for the immediate argument of a `i32.const` instruction,
  e.g. taking the address of a C++ global.
- `5 / R_WEBASSEMBLY_MEMORY_ADDR_I32` - a linear memory index encoded as a
  [uint32], e.g. taking the address of a C++ global in a static data
  initializer.
- `6 / R_WEBASSEMBLY_TYPE_INDEX_LEB` - a type table index encoded as a
  5-byte [varuint32], e.g. the type immediate in a `call_indirect`.
- `7 / R_WEBASSEMBLY_GLOBAL_INDEX_LEB` - a global index encoded as a
  5-byte [varuint32], e.g. the type immediate in a `get_global`.

Linking Metadata Section
------------------------

A linking metadata section is a user-defined section with the name
"linking".

A linking metadata section contains a series of sub-sections layed
out in the same way as the ["names"][names_sec] section:

| Field        | Type        | Description                          |
| -------------| ------------| ------------------------------------ |
| type         | `varuint7`  | code identifying type of subsection  |
| payload_len  | `varuint32` | size of this subsection in bytes     |
| payload_data | `bytes`     | content of this subsection, of length `payload_len` |

The current list of valid `type` codes are:

- `0 / WASM_STACK_POINTER` - This specifies which global variable is to be
  treated as the stack pointer.

- `1 / WASM_SYMBOL_INFO` - Specifies extra information about the symbols present
  in the module.

- `2 / WASM_DATA_SIZE` - Specifies the total size of the static data used by the
  module, including both initialized and zero-initialized (bss) data.

- `3 / WASM_DATA_ALIGNMENT` - Specifies the alignment of the data section.  This
  tells the linking what constraints are placed on the location of the data
  section in the final binary.

For `WASM_STACK_POINTER` the following fields are present in the
subsection:

| Field  | Type        | Description                                    |
| ------ | ------------| ---------------------------------------------- |
| index  | `varuint32` | index of the global which is the stack pointer |

For `WASM_SYMBOL_INFO` the following fields are present in the
subsection:

| Field  | Type            | Description                  |
| -------| --------------- | -----------------------------|
| count  | `varuint32`     | number of `syminfo` in infos |
| infos  | `syminfo*`      | sequence of `syminfo`        |

where a `syminfo` is encoded as:

| Field        | Type           | Description                                 |
| -------------| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| name_len     | `varuint32`    | length of `name_str` in bytes               |
| name_str     | `bytes`        | UTF-8 encoding of the name                  |
| flags        | `varuint32`    | a bitfield containing flags for this symbol |

The current set of valid flags for symbols are:

- `1 / WASM_SYM_FLAG_WEAK` - Indicating that this is a weak symbol

For `WASM_DATA_SIZE` the following fields are present in the
subsection:

| Field  | Type        | Description                                    |
| ------ | ------------| ---------------------------------------------- |
| size   | `varuint32` | size of the module's static data in bytes      |

For `WASM_DATA_ALIGNMENT` the following fields are present in the
subsection:

| Field  | Type        | Description                                    |
| ------ | ------------| ---------------------------------------------- |
| align  | `varuint32` | alignment requirement of the data stored as a power of 2 (`log2(alignment)`) |


Merging Global Section
----------------------

Merging of globals sections requires re-numbering of the globals.

The global identified in the linking metadata section as the stack pointer is
handled specially. During linking, only one of these globals is kept, and all
references to stack-pointer globals are rewritten to use it.

Merging Function Sections
-------------------------

Merging of the function sections requires the re-numbering of functions.  This
requires modification to code sections at each location where a function
index is embedded.  There are currently two ways in which function indices are
stored in the code section:

1. Immediate argument of the `call` instruction (calling a function)
2. Immediate argument of the `i32.const` instruction (taking the address of a
   function).

The immediate argument of all such instruction are stored as padded LEB123
such that they can be rewritten without altering the size of the code section.
For each such instruction a `R_WEBASSEMBLY_FUNCTION_INDEX_LEB` or
`R_WEBASSEMBLY_TABLE_INDEX_SLEB` `reloc` entry is generated pointing to the
offset of the immediate within the code section.

The same technique applies for all function calls whether the function is
imported or defined locally.

Merging Data Sections
---------------------

References to global data are modeled as loads or stores via a wasm
[global](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/Modules.md#global-variables).
Each C global is assigned a wasm global, and access to C global variables will
generate a `get_global` followed by a load/store to/from the resulting address.
The addresses stored in these wasm globals can then be set by the linker when it
relocates data segments.  For each wasm global that is used in this way an entry
in the `reloc` of type `R_DATA` is generated so that the linker knows which
wasm globals require modification.

External references
-------------------

Undefined external references are modeled as named [function
imports](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/Modules.md#imports).

Exported functions
------------------

Non-static functions are modeled as [function
exports](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/Modules.md#exports).
